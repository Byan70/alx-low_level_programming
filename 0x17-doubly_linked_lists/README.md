# 0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

## Description

This project focuses on the implementation of doubly linked lists in the C programming language, adhering to specific coding standards and requirements. The code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5). It follows the Betty style and is checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`. The project conforms to various guidelines, including limitations on global variables, the use of specific C standard library functions, and a maximum of 5 functions per file.

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Example main file for testing functions (Note: Do not push to the repo; only use for testing purposes)
- `lists.h`: Header file containing prototypes of all functions
- `file1.c`: Implementation of functions related to a specific feature
- `file2.c`: Implementation of functions related to another specific feature
- ...

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Code should use the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed C standard library functions: `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, `exit`

## Usage

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o executable_name
```

To run the executable:

```bash
$ ./executable_name
```

## Testing

You can use the provided `main.c` file for testing your functions. However, do not push this file to the repository, as different main files might be used during compilation.

## Header File

Ensure that all function prototypes are included in the `lists.h` header file. This file should be properly include guarded.
